### Abstract:
The U.S. is currently in the midst of a drug overdose epidemic. In 2018, 3.6% of the U.S. population misused prescription pain relievers, and there were 67,376 drug overdose deaths, more than X times the count in 1999. As the scale of the epidemic has grown, there has been a corresponding increase in the academic literature on drug overdose deaths, with studies highlighting trends in drug overdoses across time and space and characteristics of drug overdose decedents.

Yet, drug overdose deaths are only a fraction of all deaths associated with drug use. People die from drug-related disorders, which reflect long-term addiction and behavior change due to drug use. In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by describing trends in drug-related disorders in the U.S. from 1999 to 2018. We identify trends nationally and by state, focusing on areas with large relative changes in deaths involving drug-related disorders over time. We examine trends in drug-related disorders by drug class, with a particular focus on opioid-related disorders. We describe demographic and socio-economic characteristics of decedents of drug-related disorders and compare them to those of decedents from drug overdoses.

Figure 1: Trends in deaths from drug overdoses and drug-related disorders from 1999-2018. Notes: In this figure, we display the annual number of deaths from drug overdoses and drug-related disorders from 1999-2018. These estimates are based on National Center for Health Statisticsâ€™ Multiple Cause of Death Data.
